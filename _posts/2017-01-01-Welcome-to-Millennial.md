### How do these things affect your life?

-the triviality of the things that occupy peopleâ€™s daily lives
-preoccupation with material things
-worship of success and prosperity
-social climbing
-careerism
-self-centeredness
-breakdown of families
-social conformity
-sexual permissiveness
-denial of death
-trust in medical technology, and a sense of betrayal when doctors cannot heal a patient

They asked my this and I did not answer. Instead, I went and created a platform where I felt in control, I told my social group what I had done, I added links for social interaction while avoiding talking with real people about real things and I dreamed about a future that is not promised. I basked in the rays of my own ego and here I sit. A writer. Confused in her own thoughts.
