Welcome to a journey through the mind. This is basically a diary, which brings with it all associated connotations : a place to explore the dreams and aspirations of a young mind, and hopefully make them into reality. 

### It's Simple

First thing you need to know, starting a blog like this one is simple. I did it through hosting it on Github and it's absolutely free. If you've ever dreamed of going independent and creating your own blog, but it seemed out of reach, here's your chance. An article on how to make a blog like this (and not have to rely on pesky formatting and platforms like Wix, ew.) is coming soon!

### The Goal

I call this a cloud blog, maybe because it's minimalistic, and maybe because it's a reference to my "head being in the clouds". The goal of this blog is to BRING POSITIVITY ONLY. There's lots of time for negative thoughts my (and your) mind throughout the day. This blog's purpose is to explore the postitive parts. 

Look here for blogs on: Realizations about Life of a Twenty-Something Year old, How to Tutorials that Aim to Inpire You, and Preparations for Big Things, like getting ready to Travel By Myself to another Country (again, but this time for pleasure) and Financial Plans to Start My Own Air BnB stay SomeWhere In the World. Oh, and Maybe Preparing for Graduate School.

### Closing Remarks

There is two foundations of my personal philosophy:

1) The human mind is crazy beautiful, and exploring it is our responsability.

2) Nope, that's it. Enjoy my blog.
