### Why Morocco? Brazil?
It started with ["El Clon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Clone), a Brazilian series I watched during late high school, early college, that surrounds a love story between Jade, raised in Morocco and a Lucas, raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and their improbable but devout love, and the cultural obstacles that come between them. It was here that I started to learn about both countries a little more in depth, their culture.

It made a lasting impact on me, in terms of how I saw cultural differences between the Eastern and Western sides of the planet. But, importantly, it made me want to go visit these places an aweful lot, experience both sides of the cultural story, and understand. I think Wikipedia describes it accurately, checkout the link above, and [this one](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS759US760&tbm=isch&q=giovanna+antonelli&chips=q:giovanna+antonelli,g_1:el+clon:Ifcv4FFIGlE%3D&usg=AI4_-kTo9w6_a-RXboNOAk_W4sqVrAsXgw&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA9pO3qdbjAhXXG80KHathCaMQ4lYIMSgD&biw=1600&bih=762&dpr=1.2#imgrc=_) on the beautiful Giovanna Antonelli, who was the beauty queen of the show and set my beauty standards for life. Very sad that she died her hair blonde in recent years, and more on why will come in a different blog. 

### Lucia
It didn't help that people like [Lucia](https://www.instagram.com/luciaquimey/), a girl I met on my first trip abroad by myself, to Madrid while staying in a backpacker hostel in the Middle of the city, post beautiful pictures about their time in Morocco, specifically. The header for this blog is brought to you courtesy of her. 

On a side note, she is my favorite Instagrammer at the moment, mostly because her pistures focus on the art, not the luxury, of her experience and tell a cohesive narrative, unlike many others I know (the braggin nature of Instagram and wanna-be personna the platform inspires in people makes me queasy, and maybe because it's hard to live up to is why I deleted Instagram on my phone, but more on that later).

### Did Someone Say Rio?
Anyway, this combination of things has made Morocco and Brazil at the top of the list for my upcoming travel destinations, even before India, which was my other very imminent and potential travel destinations this winter. 

I have one specific blog to thank for getting the hype up for me at unprecendented levels, [The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Rio's Carnaval](http://www.theborderlessproject.com/ultimate-beginners-guide-rio-carnival-carnaval/) and would recommend it to you all if this is this blog got your traveler's spirit up. Will post a more comprehensive travel plan in the near future. 

Until then...
