 this is a blog to document the everyday journey of a girl just like anyone else, but unlike most, would like to wake up. documenting is one of the most influential ways to become self-aware and intentional and reflective in our everyday lives. Unlike some of you lucky few out there, i don't remember my life in excruting detail. i live moments, and then i forget. but i would not like to forget. i would like to be able to pull out my little laptop and write until my little heart is content. only in that way can i understand this thing called life and better proceed in a life that is deeply intentional and concious. Am i doing my best job at being me? let's find out. 
 
 I encourage you to take this blog, and recreate one similar to it, ofcourse in your own unique style. you have something to share with the world in the little thoughts that cross your mind and are too soon forgotten. why not start now?
 
 For a blog on how I set up this blog and started hosting it completely free, see my post on it:
